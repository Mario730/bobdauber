Bob Dauber is a stone sculptor and former law professor living in Scottsdale, Arizona. His first experience carving stone was in 1973, his freshman year at Pomona College. “I enrolled in a sculpture class and the instructor showed us how to use hand tools—hammers, chisels, rasps and files—to create shapes from alabaster and other soft stones. I fell in love with the process—the intense focus that carving requires, and the struggle to become one with the stone.” Although he may have had fantasies of building his own studio and becoming a sculptor back in 1973, Bob's life took a different turn. He did not pick up a hammer and chisel again for 48 years.

Looking to feed his long simmering passion to work with stone, in 2021 Bob started attending MARBLE/marble, a stone carving symposium held each summer in the town of Marble, Colorado. “My first session at MARBLE/marble was transformative. The accomplished artists at the symposium showed me how to use pneumatic and electric tools to carve marble and harder stones, and they taught me the joy of finding the sculpture in the stone. I returned to Arizona knowing I wanted to spend as much of my time carving stone as I possibly could.”  Bob continues to attend MARBLE/marble  each summer, working with sculptors from around the world.  

Sculpting marble is a meditative process for Bob. “I lose all sense of time when I am in the studio trying to shape a stone. I feel that I get to know every cubic millimeter of the rock intimately. It tells me what it is willing, and not willing, to let me do. The resulting sculpture might be quite different from the idea I had when I started carving the rock.  Usually much better.”

Most of Bob's sculptures evoke improbable, organic shapes and figures, from the whimsical to the abstract.
